Xcloud Beta unofficial V1
( Version for Nvidia shield TV only for now)

"Xcloud" is the new platform Cloud Gaming of Microsoft Xbox. The official App exist only for Mobile and Smartphone Android for now and is limited at the resolution 720p. 

I'm a lucky beta tester of the Xcloud web app (directly from browser) for PC with the full HD resolution (1080p). 
I had the project to enjoy it directly on my box TV : Nvidia shield Pro 2019.

So i decided to code an application for my shield TV for enjoying my games and sharing my app for others tester in the world. 

An official application Android tv will coming from Microsoft but certainly in more months or years.

I will uploading others version for supporting others android version and devices. 
Certainly for "Xiaomi Mi Box", the "Google Nexus Player box" and others popular android tv box.
