MY PROJECTS


******************************************************
  XCLOUD BETA V3 1080p -  FOR ANDROID TV NVIDIA SHIELD
******************************************************

Xcloud is the new platform of Cloud Gaming by Microsoft Xbox. 
The official App, exist only for Smartphone and Tablets Android at the moment,  and this is limited at the resolution 720p. 

I'm a lucky beta tester of the Xcloud Web App for PC: It's exectuted directly from the browser  on PC with the full HD resolution (1080p). 
I have the project to enjoy it directly on my box TV : The Nvidia shield Pro 2019.
So i decided to coding an application for my shield TV for enjoying my games of my gamepass ultimate.

An official application from Xbox for Android TV will be coming but certainly in somes years.
So it was a good idea and i am excited for working on this project and level up my skills on Android developpement.
